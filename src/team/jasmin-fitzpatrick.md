Jasmin is a GEOLYTIX long-timer, having left the world of Commercial Property in 2015, the gamble to join a start-up paid off. At GEOLYTIX, she looks after MAPP, our online market intelligence tool, ensuring that we deliver bespoke, innovative solutions that work for our clients.

Her role spans many aspects from client demos, to prioritising product development, to testing new functionality, to juggling a growing number of clients & demands.

She is passionate about what she does and has thoroughly enjoyed being a part of MAPP’s growth journey. She loves that no day at GEOLYTIX is the same.

Outside of work, you will often find her running and she looks forward to taking on the London Marathon later this year.
